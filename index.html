      <p>
        Lucky Shrub was founded by the dynamic husband-and-wife team, Jason and Maria. Their shared passion for plants and landscaping inspired the creation of the company. Jason,
         the resident garden architect, channels his creativity and expertise into crafting unique and enchanting designs. He not only conceptualizes the vision but also oversees 
         the implementation through his dedicated team of landscapers. Maria, the marketing maven of the duo, takes charge of all promotional activities for the company and 
         manages the day-to-day operations of the nursery.
